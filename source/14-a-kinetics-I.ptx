  <p> <em>Reaction Rates and Stoichiometry.</em> First, we define reaction rate
    and note the dependence of rates of change in concentration on reaction
    stoichiometry. </p>

  <p>
      <ul>
      <li>We distinguish between <term>instantaneous rate</term> (<m>d[]/dt</m>) and <term>average rate</term> (<m>\Delta []/\Delta t</m>).</li>
      <li>Rates of consumption (reactants) and production (products) depend on the stoichiometry of the reaction.
        Species with higher stoichiometric coefficients are consumed (produced) more rapidly!</li>
      <li><term>Standard rate</term> ("rate") is the concentration of reaction occurrences ("reactions") per unit time.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Relations between instantaneous rates of consumption and production:
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>-\frac{1}{1} \frac{d[\ce{A}]}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{d[\ce{B}]}{dt} = +\frac{1}{3} \frac{d[\ce{C}]}{dt}</m>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>Consider the reaction of ammonia with oxygen gas, a balanced equation for which is given below.</p>
      <p><m>\ce{4 NH3(g) + 5 O2(g) → 4 NO(g) + 6 H2O(g)}</m></p>
      <p>How are the rate of consumption of <m>\ce{O2}</m> and the rate of production of <m>\ce{NO}</m> related? Express the relation as a mathematical equation.</p>
      <p>
        If the rate of consumption of <m>\ce{O2}</m> is <minus />0.051 M/min, what is the rate of production of <m>\ce{NO}</m>?
